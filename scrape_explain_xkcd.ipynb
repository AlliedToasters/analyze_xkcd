Presumable he may be OK inside the tractor, but once he gets outside he becomes anxious.\\n</dd>', '<dd> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpetology\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Herpetology\">Herpetology</a> is the study of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reptiles\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:reptiles\">reptiles</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amphibians\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:amphibians\">amphibians</a>, while <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ophiophobia\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:ophiophobia\">ophiophobia</a> is the fear of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snakes\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:snakes\">snakes</a> (a reptile). The panel shows sweating Cueball holding his hands to his mouth while looking at a green snake asking for his love? It is possible that Cueball is afraid of the snake, who is harmless and just wants to be friends.\\n</dd>', '<dd> As the pun suggests, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastroenterology\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:gastroenterology\">gastroenterology</a> is the study of the human digestive system and the image shows the human <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stomach\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:stomach\">stomach</a>.

Medical school is extremely competitive and usually requires a very high undergraduate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPA\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:GPA\">GPA</a> for prospective students. Hence we see a pre-med student holding on to all his GPA results.\\n</dd>', '<dd> The text is in all lower-case, a different font and strangely laid out compared to the text in all the other panels.

We see a pipe smoking epidemiologist standing with Ponytail and watching CSI - presumably making wild claims on cause and effect based only on what they see on TV... This is, again, the point where the chorus joins in three times, as in the previous two verses.\\n</dd>', '<dd> \"Econ\" is short for \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economics\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:economics\">economics</a>\".  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Carlyle\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Thomas Carlyle\">Thomas Carlyle</a> declared economics \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_dismal_science\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:the dismal science\">the dismal science</a>\" in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Victorian era\">Victorian era</a> as a derogatory alternative name. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economists\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Economists\">Economists</a> often claim that economics is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/science\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:science\">science</a> like any other; however, as the predictive power of all economic theories are exceedingly weak compared to those of any science, this is disputed by those outside the field at times. It is of course also disputed by this song, in which Cueball \"clearly\" (see below) states that economics should not call it self a science - that is the <i>dismal science</i> is not derogatory enough for him. \\n</dd>', '<dd> End of the third verse, with yet another variant on the closing couplet. Choosing a major is compared to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_Choice\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Sophie\\'s Choice\">Sophie\\'s Choice</a>, which is any <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dilemma\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:dilemma\">dilemma</a> where choosing one cherished person or thing over the other will result in the death or destruction of the other, derived from the theme of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_Choice_(novel)\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Sophie\\'s Choice (novel)\">novel</a> of the same name, which has also been turned into a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_Choice_(film)\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Sophie\\'s Choice (film)\">romantic drama film</a>. So Cueball tells the academic advisor that choosing any of the majors over any other is as horrible as to have to choose which cherished person should die to save the other. Although in his case, it is the other way around, since he thinks all choices sucks. Again these lines would be repeated by the chorus.\\n</dd>', '<dd>[Headings to the left and above the 36 panels:]\\n</dd>', \"<dd><b>Every Major's Terrible</b>\\n</dd>\", \"<dd>to the tune of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's\\n</dd>\", '<dd><b>Modern Major-General Song</b>\\n</dd>', \"<dd>(Which you may know from Tom Lehrer's <i>Elements</i>. \\n</dd>\", '<dd>If not, just hum <i>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</i>.)\\n</dd>', '<dd>[To make it easier to read the lyrics, the lyrics text is double indented.

(Notably the UN, where the veto powers wielded by the \"big 5\" cannot be overridden and can have large impacts on global politics.) Note that it will not allow him to turn laws off (veto them) and on again (override the veto) at any moment, as once a bill becomes law it cannot be vetoed.  Without the ability to propose legislation, Black Hat\\'s powers are still limited.

So a more compressed but nonsensical string of seemingly random characters is used which links to a link of the full text address. This creates some problems for people who are security or privacy conscious and prefer to be informed beforehand where they will be traveling on the Internet. The use of shortened URLs is also central to many types of trolls or practical jokes, most notably Rickrolling (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a> for an example), by directing someone to a different location than the link would initially suggest. Thus Black Hat might be wishing to be able to tell where the links go for the purpose of avoiding this sort of trolling.\\n</dd>', '<dd> The power to control the direction news anchors are looking while they talk\\n</dd>', \"<dd>This wish likely appeals to Black Hat's mischievous side, allowing him to cause news anchors to look at the wrong camera during live broadcast. Repeatedly switching to the incorrect camera would cause havoc in the studio. Additionally, Black Hat may also attempt to get a news anchor fired by having them stare where they should not such as a female anchor's breasts.\\n</dd>\", \"<dd> The power to introduce arbitrary error into Nate Silver's predictions\\n</dd>\", '<dd>A reference to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Nate Silver\">Nate Silver</a>, who is a former writer for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_Prospectus\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Baseball Prospectus\">Baseball Prospectus</a> working on predicting baseball players\\' stats and now writes for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Thirty_Eight\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Five Thirty Eight\">Five Thirty Eight</a> in which he predicts the outcome of elections based on polling data.

Black Hat is attempting to win his game by introducing a logical contradiction: if he gets \"zero wishes\", this is one wish granted; however, if it is not granted, then, de facto, he will have been granted zero wishes. This is a common technique used in logical proofs to show that an earlier assumption does not hold (in this case, the possibility of eyelash wishing to work).\\n</dd>', '<dd> Veto power over clocks\\n</dd>', '<dd>Midnight, April 15 is the deadline for filing income tax returns in the United States.\\n</dd>', '<dd>It may also be that Black Hat, now in control of all human legislation, is attempting to extend this to further control also rules of nature -- in this case: time.

The Russian scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Rosing\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Boris Rosing\">Boris Rosing</a> was the first to use the CRT to receive a video signal.

This may be connected to the other posts (some change in human society) or it may simply be a joke at how new sexual language/fads appear and hit mainstream media from time to time (for example a number of acts gained fame from Sex and the City). This also ties in with the title text, which imagines a sensationalist headline suggesting teenagers may be doing this.\\n</dd>', \"<dd>Hydroplaning occurs when a vehicle tire comes in contact with a puddle in such a way that the water builds up between the tire and the road surface. The film of water, having a much lower coefficient of friction than the road surface, causes the tire to lose traction. Typically, in this scenario, the driver isn't planning to hydroplane and loses control of the vehicle. In theory, controlled hydroplaning would be achieved when the driver plans for it ahead of time. This could be necessary if, in this hypothetical future, most of the roads are flooded since the impact winter (after only four years) ends and thus a great thaw causes all roads to become wet all the time.\\n</dd>\", '<dd>\"paradoxical reaction\" is a medical term for when the outcome of a medical treatment, typically the taking of a drug, is the opposite of that expected. For example if taking a pain relieving medication made the pain worse. For this term to suddenly become well known, a large scale or particularly notable case must have taken place (such as the insect-borne disease of 2019). Or, this and the following (and maybe the last as well) phrases may refer to the events from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evitable_Conflict\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:The Evitable Conflict\">The Evitable Conflict</a> by Isaac Asimov (and its very loose but much more popular film adaptation <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot_(film)\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:I, Robot (film)\">I, Robot</a>) where robots, instructed with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Three Laws of Robotics\">Three Laws of Robotics</a>, take over the world to prevent humans hurting each other. The paradoxical reaction is that these laws were specifically designed to, among other things, prevent robots from taking over the world in the first place.\\n</dd>', '<dd>Desertion is the abandonment of a post or duty, usually military in nature. With the increasing use of autonomous drones by the military this hints at an event where drones \\'decide\\' to desert, possibly due to unspecified advances in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Artificial Intelligence\">Artificial Intelligence</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Rights\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Robot Rights\">Robot Rights</a>. Or maybe they just start following the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Three Laws of Robotics\">Three Laws of Robotics</a>.\\n</dd>', '<dd>Maybe some humans have developed a very rapid hair growth (presumably on the entire body) through evolution and natural selection caused by the cold years of the impact winter.\\n</dd>', '<dd>This is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath#Divine_oath\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Oath\">divine oath</a>. A possible explanation is that after the impact and the desertion of the drones predicted for 2033, a strong fraction has made their leader divine, and everyone now has to swear allegiance to this new God-Empress using this phrase - which would certainly make it a very \"popular\" phrase. The phrase <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor\">God-Emperor</a> was popularized in the science-fiction work <i>Dune</i> in 1965 and has been repeatedly referenced since, notably in the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000 (and related media).\\n</dd>', '<dd>Obscure words and phrases everyone suddenly becomes very familiar with.\\n</dd>', '<dd>[A time line to the left is marked of by several phrases to the right around the time they became familiar to the public:]\\n<dl><dd>← World Wide Web\\n</dd><dd>← DNA Evidence\\n</dd></dl>\\n</dd>', '<dd>← World Wide Web\\n</dd>', '<dd>← DNA Evidence\\n</dd>', '<dd>1995\\n<dl><dd>← Militia Movement\\n</dd><dd>← Supermax\\n</dd></dl>\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Militia Movement\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Supermax\\n</dd>', '<dd>2000\\n<dl><dd>← Butterfly Ballot\\n</dd><dd>← Al-Qaeda\\n</dd><dd>← Wi-Fi\\n</dd></dl>\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Butterfly Ballot\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Al-Qaeda\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Wi-Fi\\n</dd>', '<dd>2005\\n<dl><dd>← Tsunami\\n</dd><dd>← Viral\\n</dd></dl>\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Tsunami\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Viral\\n</dd>', '<dd>2010\\n<dl><dd>← Radicalize\\n</dd><dd>← Metadata\\n</dd></dl>\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Radicalize\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Metadata\\n</dd>', '<dd>2015\\n<dl><dd>← Lahar\\n</dd><dd>← Insect-Borne\\n</dd></dl>\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Lahar\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Insect-Borne\\n</dd>', '<dd>2020\\n<dl><dd>← Earth-Crossing\\n</dd><dd>← Thermohaline\\n</dd><dd>← Snow-Blindness\\n</dd></dl>\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Earth-Crossing\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Thermohaline\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Snow-Blindness\\n</dd>', '<dd>2025\\n<dl><dd>← Amplexus\\n</dd><dd>← Controlled Hydroplaning\\n</dd></dl>\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Amplexus\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Controlled Hydroplaning\\n</dd>', '<dd>2030\\n<dl><dd>← Paradoxical Reaction\\n</dd><dd>← Drone Desertion\\n</dd><dd>← Rapid Hair Growth \\n</dd></dl>\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Paradoxical Reaction\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Drone Desertion\\n</dd>', '<dd>← Rapid Hair Growth \\n</dd>', '<dd>2035\\n<dl><dd>← I Swear Allegiance To The God-Empress In Life And In Death\\n</dd></dl>\\n</dd>', '<dd>← I Swear Allegiance To The God-Empress In Life And In Death\\n</dd>', '<dd>2040\\n</dd>']}\n"

Luulen, että ne yrittävät löytää suojan. Kuusien ja mäntyjen oksistossa on varmaan suojaisaa. Kallioiden koloihin ja pieniin luolastoihin voi ehkä lintukin hiipiä. Rohkeille löytyy pihoilta suojapaikkoja. Ehkä linnulla oli oma pesäkolo. Siellä oli lämmintä ja kuivaa. Sieltä saattoi rauhassa katsella sateen vierailua metsässä.

Their own self-preservation is last, so they must also try to save a human, even if ordered not do so, and especially also if they would put themselves to harm, or even destroy themselves in the process. They would also have to obey orders not relating to humans, even if this would be harmful to them; like exploring a mine field. This leads to a balanced, if not perfect, world.

In addition to the general risk (e.g. of unexpected damage), it is actually normal for rovers to cease operating (\"die\") at the end of their mission, though they may survive longer than expected (see <a href=\"/wiki/index.php/1504:_Opportunity\" title=\"1504: Opportunity\">1504: Opportunity</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/index.php/695:_Spirit\" title=\"695: Spirit\">695: Spirit</a>).

Also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:murder\">murder</a> charges can range in from first to third degree in for instance the US.

But the substitution fits best with murder or burn, as Friggin(g) is a \"softer\" swear word than for instance other more commonly used four letter words. It often replaces <i>fuck</i>.

It can also mean the front-runner in athletic events (the namesake of the political concept). Here it is generally clear who the front-runner is, whilst the political front-runner is sometimes less clear or a more subjective viewpoint. A \\'blade runner\\' is a person who retires (kills) rogue cyborgs in the movie Blade Runner, where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Harrison Ford\">Harrison Ford</a> plays the lead Blade Runner.\\n</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Globe\">Global</a>\\n</td>\\n<td> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Spherical\">Spherical</a>\\n</td>\\n<td> Global comes from globe, but means so much more today.

But since a globe is spherical, this substitution makes more sense than most, although talking about <i>the effect of spherical warming</i> would probably not get <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Greenpeace\">Greenpeace</a> into action. Might be confusing if an actual physical object affecting Earth were described as being sphere-like, rather than as occuring around the globe.\\n</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Years\">Years</a>\\n</td>\\n<td> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Minute\">Minutes</a>\\n</td>\\n<td> It will often make a sentence lose its meaning when changing the units drastically from years to minutes (there are 525600 minutes in the usual 365 days present in a year).

This is often seized upon by those trying to promote a pseudoscience, in that their chosen idea \"has not been proven to be wrong\" (and yet, conversely, \"it\\'s just a theory\" is incorrectly used to refute something that has valid scientific backing). Moreover, hearsay and bad experimental practices are often cited as \\'proof\\'. A crackpot idea may thus be unsupported by valid science (there is \\'no indication\\' of its truth) and yet its supporters insist upon there being \\'lots of signs\\' that it is true, selectively using only ambiguous results that (to them, at least) lend credence to it being a fact. The substitution of \\'no indication\\' with \\'lots of signs\\' thus automatically converts the expected conservative and cautious stance on some disputed issue or other into the weasel-words phrasing that the issue\\'s supporters may start using in their own propaganda.\\n</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/urge\">Urged</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Self-control\">restraint</a> by\\n</td>\\n<td> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Alcohol intoxication\">Drunkenly</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/egg_on\">egged on</a>\\n</td>\\n<td> If someone urges someone else to restrain themselves, then they are trying to make them exercise self-control, and discourage them from starting or continuing a possibly foolish act.

Though this system has been officially sanctioned for use in the US since 1866, it is not frequently used in daily American life (except for some things, like liter bottles of soda), although it is the preferred system for trade and commerce according to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_Conversion_Act\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Metric Conversion Act\">Metric Conversion Act</a> of 1975. The US remains the only industrialized country that has not adopted the metric system as its official system of measurement. The unit <i>degree Celsius</i> or °C is an accepted <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Derived_units\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:International System of Units\">derived unit</a> from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:International System of Units\">International System of Units</a> (SI units) used in science (which again is the modern form of the metric system). The SI unit of temperature is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kelvin\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:kelvin\">kelvin</a>, but this temperature scale is linearly related to the Celsius scale, which is why Celsius can be derived from it.\\n</dd>', '<dd><b>The Fahrenheit scale</b> is from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:United States customary units\">US customary system</a> and the (British) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Imperial units\">Imperial system</a>. The unit is <i>degree Fahrenheit</i> or °F, and the relation to the Celsius scale is not easy to find in a mental calculation. The relations are: [°F] = [°C]×9⁄5 + 32 or [°C] = ([°F] − 32)×5⁄9. (For this exact reason Randall has previously made a helpful table for these situations in <a href=\"/wiki/index.php/526:_Converting_to_Metric\" title=\"526: Converting to Metric\">526: Converting to Metric</a>).\\n</dd>', '<dd><b>Radian</b> is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. An angle\\'s measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unit_circle\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:unit circle\">unit circle</a>. It has no units and is denoted with the superscript <sup>c</sup>, but more commonly <sup>rad</sup>, lest it be confused with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Degree (angle)\">angular degrees</a>.\\n</dd>', '<dd><b>Angular degrees</b> is a system used to measure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angles\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:angles\">angles</a> in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geometry\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:geometry\">geometry</a>, and although it used the unit ° it has nothing to do with temperature gradations of whichever scale. \\n</dd>', '<dd>Degrees Celsius is derived unit in the SI system of units used to measure temperature in most countries today. Using the SI system would allow Cueball to be easily understood in most countries and is by far the most recognized system, but it is not the most commonly used in the United States, his actual location in the comic.\\n</dd>', '<dd>The United States uses its own set of units, including degrees Fahrenheit, called the United States customary system and similar but not equal to the Imperial system, in contrast to most of the rest of the world which uses the SI system. The US\\'s system of units is therefore considered \"weird\" as it makes the US different from most of the world, but previous efforts to convert the US to the SI system have failed. Cueball evidently believes that by using SI units he will help to eventually convert the US to the SI system, bringing considerable trade and tourism benefits and reducing confusion when dealing with foreigners.\\n</dd>', '<dd>On the Celsius scale, the freezing point of water at standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kilopascals) is very close to 0\\xa0°C, and any temperature below that is \"below\" the freezing point. The Fahrenheit scale uses different points of reference (using a water/ammonium chloride chemical reaction for the lower calibration, while the upper calibration is set such that water freezing and water boiling are 180 degrees apart), and as a result the freezing point of water is a less memorable 32\\xa0°F.\\n</dd>', '<dd>Cueball is apparently a physics major, like Randall, and SI units are more commonly used for scientific work (as the Kelvin scale is sometimes used in advanced Physics), even in the US. By using the Celsius scale in casual conversation he would show his loyalty to the system used by actual physicists.\\n</dd>', '<dd>\"Celsius\" is generally considered to be an easier word to spell than the German surname \"Fahrenheit\" (At least this is the case for Cueball, but not necessarily for those who more commonly use Fahrenheit than Celsius). In this case the word is being spoken and the point is not immediately relevant, but part of the joke is that Cueball is overthinking things and worrying about the general use of the word when an answer is needed in this specific case.\\n</dd>', '<dd>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Mars Climate Orbiter\">Mars Climate Orbiter</a> disintegrated in Mars\\' atmosphere because Lockheed used US customary units instead of the contractually specified metric units. Note that this had nothing to do with temperature scales, but was the use of the unit pound-seconds where newton-seconds should have been used. This was a great and tragic loss for science in general, Mars exploration in particular, and thus also for Randall who has shown deep interest in any kind of space exploration, especially regarding Mars (more or less mentioning all Mars rovers in his comics so far).\\n</dd>', '<dd>In the context of air temperature, 0\\xa0°F and 100\\xa0°F correspond to \"just about as cold as it gets\" and \"just about as hot as it gets\" in temperate zones, thereby making Fahrenheit a useful temperature scale for weather reporting where most people live. By contrast, in Celsius a range of common temperatures in temperate zones is -20\\xa0°C to 40\\xa0°C, which is a less intuitive range for those used to the Fahrenheit scale.\\n</dd>', \"<dd>An argument sometimes heard for the continued use of Fahrenheit temperatures is that each 10 degrees change is meaningful in how we feel the temperature. Thus, it is convenient to talk about the temperature being in the 70's today, or in the 90's, etc. Since the Celsius degrees are almost twice as large, a similar statement about the temperature being in the 20's or 30's is not as useful, unless more precision is added by using phrases like low 20's or high 30's. However, this seems likely to be more a matter of which scale you are used to using than anything inherent in one scale or the other.\\n</dd>\", '<dd>If you need to constantly convert between Imperial and SI measurements in your head, or even between different Imperial units (e.g., ounces and pounds), it gets annoying and is a strong argument for everyone using metric measurements all the time. But, when it is easy to get the temperature - or any other measurement - reported in whatever units you want just by selecting the units you want your computer to report, then the annoyance is minimized, and the arguments for why we should stop using a familiar scale are weakened.  Note that Cueball is looking at his smart-phone to get the current temperature.\\n</dd>', '<dd>As many Americans, Randall is confusing the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:United States customary units\">United States customary system</a> with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_system\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Imperial system\">Imperial system</a> used in most of the rest of the English speaking world. In both systems temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit.\\n</dd>', \"<dd>One of the nice things about SI measurements is how the same basic unit scales by factors of 10 with common prefixes - e.g., kilometer, millimeter, kilogram, milligram, etc.  Imperial measurements don't have this feature - you don't talk about long distances as kiloinches or small weights as millipounds. But, we generally don't use multiple units for atmospheric temperature (millidegrees or kilodegrees), so this argument for using SI measurements for length, mass, volume, etc., isn't as applicable for temperature scales.\\n</dd>\", '<dd>Cueball apparently knows that the inquirer is most likely to assume the answer will be in degrees Fahrenheit, so giving the answer that way would be the least likely to be misinterpreted. If he surprisingly gives an answer in Celsius, without explicitly stating he is reporting the temperature in Celsius, then that could be confusing. \\n</dd>', \"<dd>The final thing Cueball considers is to question why he would give an answer that attaches more value to promoting standardization of units when all his friend wants to know is whether it is cold or warm outside. Wouldn't it be more friendly to just answer the question the way his friend will find most convenient? This is probably the reason he ends up not giving any real answer, as giving the answer in Celsius would make him a bad friend. That giving the answer in radians will make him a weird friend might feel better.\\n</dd>\", '<dd>[Cueball is looking at his smartphone while a friend calls to him from off-panel.

It has rounded corners and it is gray with white text. From this box there is a gray line to a box consisting of a black frame with rounded corners. In these kind of boxes there are questions regarding the map in black text. Below this box there are three gray boxes like the start box, superimposed over the bottom frame. In these boxes are the possible answers to the question in the frame above. From each of these options there is a gray line going to similar black framed boxes with other questions either below, or to either side. There can either be two, three or four gray boxes, two the most common. Only at the very bottom of the central branch where it turns out it was a home made map, are there two frames with only one gray question box each. This trend continues over this entire large image. When reaching the end of a branch in the flow chart, there is no line away from one, more or all of the gray boxes for a black frame. When this happens a year range or a guess at what the map shows, or what it is (if it turns out to not be a map) is written below the gray box in gray text. Of the text in the gray boxes are Yes/No, but not always. There are 74 boxes with black frames with 158 gray boxes and 78 endpoints with text below the gray box and one end point without text below (the one with the home made map).]\\n</dd>', '<dd>Start\\n<dl><dd>Istanbul or Constantinople?\\n<dl><dd>Constantinople\\n<dl><dd><span id=\"canada-alaska-tokyo\"><u>Do any of these exist</u>?

As different environments can have differing levels of background noise, an adjusment such as a knob is required to set the level at which the squelch circuit deactivates and lets audio through (\"opening\" or \"breaking\" the squelch). For a smartphone, perhaps this knob could control the \"signal-to-noise\" ratio of your Facebook feed or other social media platforms.

Once developed for sea shipping, it is accurate to about 300 meters (1,000 feet). The joke, of course, is that all modern smartphones have integrated GPS navigation which is far more accurate. Due to the much lower frequencies involved, reception of LORAN signals though is much better in areas with obstructed view of the sky.

Secure applications may include two or more factors; a common example is the \"PIN and chip\" system used with credit cards, where you need both the card and secret code to authorize a transaction. Many online services now provide two-factor authentication to protect against password-based attacks. 28-factor authentication would likely be very secure in theory but also so impractical that it would be unusable. The user will need to prove their identity 28 different ways which would be so time consuming that would outweigh the convenience of a smart phone.

The camera lens is located on the same side of the phone's case as the main screen and therefore it is possible to capture the image of the user's face looking at the screen and display the interlocutor's face on the screen simultaneously, enabling video chat. However, as the camera is usually located above the screen, a user looking at the displayed image of the other person directs his or her eyes at the center of the screen and not at the camera's lens. This is very visible on the other end of the chat as if the person talking was looking down and not in the interlocutor's face which is an uncomfortable situation for most people. For this reason, professionals involved in movie or TV-making, like actors or reporters, are trained to look straight into the camera's lens while talking, which creates impression of looking straight at the viewer's face. During a video chat, however, looking into the lens of an above-screen camera does not allow one to see the interlocutor's face clearly because it is then in the peripheral field of vision.\\n</dd>\", \"<dd> To solve this conundrum, Randall proposes locating the camera lens right in the middle of the screen. Therefore the user looking at the screen to see the other person's face would be also looking at the lens, creating an impression of a straight look on the other end of the chat. This is absurd since the lens would then take place of some of the center pixels of the screen, not allowing the display the center part of the captured image of the other person's face (like eyes and/or lips) which is most important for nonverbal communication. Such location of the camera lens would also likely interfere with touch-screen function. It will make other applications on the phone difficult to use, since virtually no user interface is designed to accommodate for a blind spot in the center.\\n</dd>\", \"<dd> The idea of having the camera in the middle of the screen is only currently absurd, however, as advances in technology may enable such a feature to eventually work without disturbing the appearance or function of the phone's display, unlike the visual disturbance clearly indicated in the comic. For instance, previous technological advancements have improved the functionality of the display, starting with adding touch sensing. The touch sensitive hardware of the phone is located in thin a layer above the hardware that generates the image for the display, and capacitive touch sensing tech is less obtrusive than tech implementing previous resistive sensing. Though it has yet to be released to market, certain manufacturers are aiming to place the fingerprint reader for a phone underneath the screen, for seamless functionality. Though it may be difficult at this point, figuring a way to have a camera capture images through the array of pixels on the screen is not completely beyond imagination.\\n</dd>\", '<dd> Phone cameras tend to have lenses which are quite small and round or square -- same width as height.  Full-width makes it sound like the camera lens is really wide, as in a long oval or rectangle shape.  This could allow the camera to gather a lot more light, potentially working in low light situations.  However the lens would be more vulnerable to damage and dirt.  Unless a very large sensor was used, focusing the image could be a problem, since cell phones are typically not very deep.\\n</dd>', '<dd> U.S. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> is a government agency tasked with addressing public health concerns such as infectious diseases, including seasonal flu. A common way of limiting spread of an infectious disease is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Vaccine\">vaccination</a>, which most often involves administering a specially prepared medicine via an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intramuscular_injection\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:intramuscular injection\">intramuscular injection</a>. Researchers have investigated other delivery systems, including aerosol, or microneedle injection.  This features implies that the phone would automatically perform some form of injection once a year, administering vaccine via a small aperture while the user is holding the phone to his or her cheek during a call. However, the placement of this component is unusual as it would line up with the user\\'s ear rather than cheek during a phone call. It may be designed to detect the fraction of a second your cheek would be in the appropriate position (perhaps after a phone call, as you may be dropping the phone from your ear), to administer it at that moment; this would conveniently prevent disturbances to a majority of conversations.\\n</dd>', \"<dd> A further absurdity to this feature is that the vaccine is different every year, in order to account for various mutations causing different and typically new strains of the virus (thus the reason it has to be administered yearly). The CDC bases the combination of strains on a best-guess of what will be the most significant strains in circulation over the upcoming year, and so in order to have the current year's vaccine, the user would have to physically load the vaccine into the phone for later administration, or there would have to be a mechanism to synthesize the concoction on-board the phone and an associated logistics framework and digital standards for OTA delivery of specifications for the year's vaccine.\\n</dd>\", '<dd> Most smartphones can be used for more than 12 different things<sup>[<a href=\"/wiki/index.php/285\" title=\"285\" class=\"mw-redirect\"><i>citation needed</i></a>]</sup>.

Several threads may share memory making them a process. Threads are meant to run in parallel and the operating system distributes the workload on the available hardware execution units. These execution units are sometimes called hardware threads, especially when there is more than one per processing unit (or core). For example, the Intel Core i7 7700 is considered a 4-core, 8-thread CPU. The vague \"high thread count\" statement could make sense in this context, however, it is most likely a joke about bedding, where it is an actual selling point.  High thread count is a marketing term for linens, where it signifies the density of threads in a textile. \\n</dd>', '<dd>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Shroud of Turin\">Shroud of Turin</a> contains an image of a face -- originally believed to be of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Jesus Christ\">Jesus Christ</a>, before the Shroud was found to be 1200 years too young.

This is likely a reference to the iPhone X\\'s FaceID unlock, which uses a <i>photograph</i> of your face augmented with spatial information to unlock it and which had attracted <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/iphone-x-faceid-security/\">significant criticism</a> immediately before this comic came out.\\n</dd>', '<dd> Between 1975 and 1992 NASA used the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_insignia\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:NASA insignia\">\"worm\" logotype</a> in its insignia.

This seems impressive, as NASA technology does tend to be quite strong and advanced, as they claim at their <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://spinoff.nasa.gov/\">spin off</a> website. However, it would not be as impressive due to fonts having very little to do with NASA\\'s core operations.<sup>[<a href=\"/wiki/index.php/285\" title=\"285\" class=\"mw-redirect\"><i>citation needed</i></a>]</sup>\\n</dd>', '<dd> What tampon packages, cosmetics, paints, and other products often say.  An applicator for a phone would be absurd since the phone cannot be applied, spread, inserted, or attached to something else. This may be referring back to the aforementioned yearly vaccine.\\n</dd>', '<dd> There is marketing, trying to appear to be using clean energy, due to pollution concerns.  Coal burning power plants are usually quite large, so a traditional coal fired thermal-electric plant in a cell phone would be absurd.  However, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Fuel cell\">fuel cells</a>, which produce electricity by oxidizing some fuel can be small enough to fit in a cell phone, but they do not typically burn coal.  Clean coal is coal that is burned so that it does not give off as much soot, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, or other pollutants as \"normal\" coal, or methods of burning coal that give off relatively less pollutants. (The cordless charging port might be receptacle for refueling the phone, using liquid, or using a fuel cartridge.)\\n</dd>', \"<dd>Pre-seasoned typically refers to cast iron cookware which is ready to use out of the box, as opposed to needing to season it with oil and heat. It can also refer to packaged meats which are ready to cook without needing to be seasoned with herbs and spices, or timber that has been dried and is ready for use. A more technical definition of 'seasoning' means operating devices, usually calibrated standards or battery cells, for a while in the factory, to make sure the device meets constant performance requirements without deviating or diminshing too much. In this sense it could apply to the battery of the phone.\\n</dd>\", '<dd>The xkcd phone somehow gives a sun protection factor (SPF) 30 level of protection for the skin from sun light.  Perhaps the phone itself blocks 97% of UVB radiation (this being the definition of \"SPF 30\"), allowing 3% through, although this would be remarkably more translucent than most phones (which allow much less than 1% of UVB, or any other visible or near-visible wavelength, through).  This would only apply to the patch of skin it blocks sunlight from.\\n</dd>', '<dd>College-ruled is a style of notebook paper having narrower lines in order to fit more text per page. That the phone is college-ruled suggests that there are lines permanently displayed on the screen, which would obscure any images on the screen, along with any text that doesn\\'t line up with the lines. Defective screens can show similar patterns. For example, the iPhone 6 \"touch disease\" cause regularly spaced vertical lines to appear on top of the screen. Here, it is possible that the manufacturer tries to pass off screen defects as features.\\n</dd>', '<dd>Useful for medical supplies, less so in a phone.\\n</dd>', \"<dd>The discovery of the radioactive element radium sparked a brief fad in which some watch makers painted watch faces or hands with a paint containing radium and a radioluminescent substance, such as zinc sulfide, which converted the radiation from the radium into visible light. This allowed the time to be read at night without an external power source for the light. However, it was eventually realized that regular exposure to radium could result in radiation poisoning, particularly for the workers assembling and painting the watches.  A radium-based backlight would therefore be both potentially dangerous (especially for an object carried on one's person much of the time) but also largely useless, as the radioluminescent light is rather dim compared to conventional phone back lights.\\n</dd>\", '<dd>\"4K\" typically denotes a screen with a width of ~4000 pixels, for example in 4K TVs which have 4096×2160 pixels, or 8.8 million pixels total.  That would be an outstanding resolution for a cell phone.  Here, however, the \"fine print\" in parentheses clarifies that 4000 is actually the total number of pixels, not the width.  This is horrendous.  As a comparison, the old Commodore VIC-20 with a resolution of 176 × 184 would have over 8 times the pixels of this phone.

However \"santa\" is not plural in any of these languages (for example, in Portuguese the proper plural would be \"santos\").

Achieving this velocity by means of bending then straightening the legs would require an acceleration of roughly 25,000 G, placing extraordinarily high demands on the strength of the legs. As Santa does not have a particularly aerodynamic shape, air resistance would increase the launch velocity and launch acceleration requirements substantially.

They may also choose such a registry to help obscure ownership of the vessel. Which concern applies in the case of Santa\\'s sleigh is not stated, or (more likely) not known. It may also be the only type of registration available, since the north pole is not in any country, so there is no \"owner\\'s country\".\\n</dd>', '<dd>However, a ship\\'s flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship\\'s equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. One suspects that this does <b>not</b>, in fact, happen regularly with Santa\\'s sleigh. Also, as a <i>flying</i> sleigh, the registry for <i>ocean-going</i> vessels is not applicable. Instead, it would be registered as an aircraft, with the FAA (in the U.S.), EASA (in Europe), or the equivalent in another country. Civilian aircraft have their registration number painted on their tails, but are not required to display a \"flag\". (However, U.S. Airways used a stylized version of a U.S. flag as a corporate logo prior to its merger with American Airlines.)\\n</dd>', '<dd>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:United States presidential line of succession\">Presidential Line of Succession</a> specifies the order in which persons may become or act as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:President of the United States\">President of the United States</a> if the incumbent President becomes incapacitated, dies, resigns, or is removed from office. Having Santa as the 9th in that order would place him above the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Agriculture\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:United States Secretary of Agriculture\">Secretary of Agriculture</a>. An alternative interpretation would hold that Santa <b>is</b> the present Secretary of Agriculture, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Perdue\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonny Perdue\">Sonny Perdue</a>.\\n</dd>', '<dd>Assuming Sonny Perdue is not Santa Claus, Santa is likely ineligible for the Presidency, as most origin stories of Santa have him a natural-born citizen of a European country (or of Turkey) rather than the United States.  Alternately, Santa might be old enough to qualify under the \"citizen at the time of the adoption of this constitution\" clause, although in light of the information that Santa is actually an arthropod and/or a vampire (see below), his status as an American citizen is dubious. \\n</dd>', '<dd>This \"fact\" uses an absurd misconception to correct a relatively common misconception. Absurdly, Randall has mistaken Santa for a lobster, given his bright red coloration and the surname Claus (which is pronounced the same as a lobster\\'s \"claws\"). This may be an homage to the film the Nightmare Before Christmas, where Jack Skellington believes Christmas Town is led by \"Sandy Claws\" who is \"like a lobster, huge and red\".\\n</dd>', '<dd>There is a relatively common misconception that lobsters are insects. In fact, lobsters are crustaceans, but there is a kernel of truth to the misconception, as crustaceans and insects are related (both are arthropods).  Thus, the \"fact\" states that Lobster-Santa is not technically an insect; he is actually an arthropod. \\n</dd>', '<dd>In traditional vampire folklore, a vampire cannot enter an abode without an invitation from the owner of the same. Santa, however, seems to be able to enter houses even without explicit invitation (although plenty of children do welcome him, either via written notes or by their general sentiments), so if he is a vampire he is the exception to that rule. This juxtaposes interestingly with the previous point about his arthropod nature.\\n</dd>', '<dd>His being a vampire is perhaps related to his dressing all in red, and alleged immortality. \\n</dd>', '<dd>May mean that Alexa (Amazon\\'s virtual assistant) is Santa\\'s colleague, that Santa uses Alexa in his work, or Santa is functionally compatible with Alexa. A common advertisement states that a product is compatible with Amazon\\'s smart device, Alexa. But it could also be a play on the idea or fear that Alexa may be used to spy on people from the privacy of their own homes, much like what is claimed of Santa (\"he sees you when you\\'re sleeping, [...]\").\\n</dd>', '<dd>A reference to condoms, which have ridges or ribbing in order to promote pleasurable stimulation during coitus (see \"Lubricated\" above). This also puns on the fact that, as a humanoid, Santa presumably has a rib cage. (This might directly contradict the claims about his being an arthropod.)\\n</dd>', '<dd>The <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.iucn.org/about\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) monitors the size and viability of populations of organisms; \\'critically endangered\\' marks a population as being highly susceptible to extinction. Santa, being one (or possibly two, if we include his wife) of a kind and lacking any offspring (and, indeed, likely being incapable of effectively producing any), will most likely be the last member of his population; thus extinction will arrive with his or his wife\\'s death. Note, however, that the presence on the Red List implies that \"Santa\" is a biological species, not a fantasy, robot, or other non-biological entity. This is consistent with Santa being an arthropod and/or vampire, but would suggest that there are many specimens of Santa, while other \\'Facts\\' (such as having a definite ranking in the Presidential Line of Succession) suggest Santa to be a single individual. \\n</dd>', \"<dd>A mocking allusion to Santa Claus's sleigh, usually pulled by reindeer. Usual folklore depict Santa Claus being extremely fond of his reindeer, thus making it a humorous contrast to suggest he'd be <i>eating</i> reindeer meat on a daily basis.\\n</dd>\", \"<dd>As a result of his diet (see above), alleged criminal activity (ditto), species ambiguity, and occupation, Santa would find the cost of liability insurance quite high. He instead chooses to 'go bare' and operate without any.\\n</dd>\", '<dd>[An annotated picture of Santa is shown.]\\n</dd>', '<dd><b>Santa</b>\\n</dd>', '<dd>Facts and Figures\\n</dd>', '<dd>Type: Flying/Psychic\\n</dd>', '<dd>Plural: \"Santa\"\\n</dd>', '<dd>Active Warrants: 5\\n</dd>', '<dd>Lubricated for easy passage down chimneys\\n</dd>', '<dd>Vertical leap: 14 Miles\\n</dd>', '<dd>Sleigh flag of convenience: Panama\\n</dd>', '<dd>9th in presidential line of succession\\n</dd>', '<dd>Not technically an insect—actually an arthropod\\n</dd>', '<dd>Only known vampire able to enter house without being invited\\n</dd>', '<dd>Works with Alexa\\n</dd>', '<dd>Ribbed\\n</dd>', '<dd>IUCN red list: Critically endangered\\n</dd>', '<dd>Diet: 80% Reindeer\\n</dd>', '<dd>Liability Insurance: None\\n</dd>']}\n"
